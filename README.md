# Jozwald-Applet-Emulator
An attempt at a Java Applet Emulator following some obscure Applet Interface lost to time. Made November 2016 

## Description
This is an untouched version of my final product as it was on completion, November 6th 2016. At the time this was my most techinally impressive feat of java engineering. I have no idea what I was thinking with my branding, I was 16 years old and had odd tastes. The actual application only KIND of works, for some reason there were lots of unforseen issues with java.swing that messed up rending the applets. 

## Running
This program was written to run from a path prefixed with "F:" but I changed it to "C:" for this github upload since no one has an "F:" drive and most people would have a "C:" drive running windows. If for some reason you want to run this godforsaken application, `/joz/"dep run.bat"` will run the emulator, but you should recompile it first.  

## Screenshots:
These are some pictures from the application:

### Loading screen
There is nothing to load, I just wanted to make loading screen. I have no idea why I put a GNU seal of approval, I think I was going through a Richard Stallman phase. Please ignore my 16 year old weeb tastes.

### Main Menu
Lists java applets it finds available to run. Offers ability to run and terminiate diffrent applets.

### Emulating an Applet
Emulating the Box applet from /Box.java as you can see, swing kind of messes up and the button gets cut inhalf.
