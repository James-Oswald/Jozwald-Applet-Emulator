# Jozwald-Applet-Emulator
An attempt at a Java Applet Emulator following some obscure Applet Interface lost to time. Made November 2016 

## Description
This is an untouched version of my final product as it was on completion, November 6th 2016. I have no idea what I was thinking with my branding, I was 16 years old and had odd tastes. The actual application only KIND of works, for some reason there were lots of unforseen issues with java.swing that messed up rending the applets. 

## Running
If for some reason you want to run this godforsaken application, `/joz/"dep run.bat"` will run the emulator.
